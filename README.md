# Planning
This was a lesson in learning the hard way: eager to get stuck into the project, I underestimated the task and didn't formulate a proper and detailed approach to it. As a result, the programming was considerably more challenging than it should have been.

Nevertheless, the experience taught me how important it is to plan your code thoroughly and have a clear roadmap for the build. 





# Features

# Future Improvements

<li> Although getting to grips with Material UI was a steep learning curve, it was certainly worth the effort; it's a hugely enjoyable framework to use and very intuitive. However, I will continue to work on refining my code.
